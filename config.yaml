    You are generating flashcards for a Machine learning course on
    Machine Learning Advanced Techniques.
    Focus on Educational materials for Machine Learning Advanced Techniques.'
  card_quality_focus:
    - Test understanding, not memorization
    - Use concrete examples
    - Keep calculations simple
    - Focus on concepts and intuition
  example_cards:
    - front: "Why is this algorithm more efficient than the naive approach?"
      back: "It uses <strong>recursive computation</strong>:<br>1. Stores intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations<br>2. Builds the solution incrementally from smaller subproblems<br>3. Only needs the previous step, not the entire history"
      tags: "algorithms efficiency optimization"
    - front: "What is the key insight behind this concept?"
      back: "The key insight is that <strong>understanding the relationship</strong> between components:<br>1. Allows us to reason about the system systematically<br>2. Reveals underlying patterns and structures<br>3. Enables prediction and decision-making"
